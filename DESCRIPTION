Description: Toolbox for easy and interactive reading and writing of data files

 dataINT offers functions for convenient, interactive im-/export of test-based 
 data files (*.csv, *.dat, *.txt) to or from a Scilab matrix or from a binary 
 Excel files (*.xls), respectively. 
 
 Parameters, to specify the im-/export, can conveniently entered in a dialog  
 box and the file selection is done by the platform-specific 
 file selection dialog.
 
 You can specify the following im-/export parameters:
 - Field separator (comma, semicolon, tab, space)
 - Decimal separator (comma, point)
 - Rows and columns you want to import
 - Sheet you want to import 
 - Number of lines to skip, e.g. header line(s)
 - Comment header line to describe your data 
 
 IMPORTANT: dataINT does not handle data from XML-based Excel files (.xlsx)!
 NOTE: dataINT handles doubles only.
 
 The functions can easily integrated in your own scripts to make use of 
 dataINT's interactive functionality or to simplify your data import in 
 Scilab's console.
 
 FUNCTIONS:
 
 * DI_read
   Combines functionality of DI_readcsv and DI_readxls in one function
 * DI_show
   Read the first 25 or an arbitrary number of lines of a text data file,    
   displays them in the console and invoke the reading procedure after, if
   desired.
 * DI_writedat
   Write comma-separated value files (*.csv, *.dat, *.txt) interactively.
 
 dataINT is available for Scilab 5.5.x, 6.0.x and 6.1.x. Furthermore 
 dataINT is cross-platform.

 CHANGELOG:

 - DI_writedat replaces DI_writecsv
 - Deprecation of DI_readcsv and DI_readxls. Successor of both is DI_read
  
 1.1.1
 - Fix decimal-comma-bug when reading/parsing space separated text files 
   with decimal commas
 
 1.1.0 
 - DI_read function introduced
 - Better input parameter checking
 - Easier input of data ranges for import
 
 1.0.1 Bug fixes: 
 - "test" print in DI_readcsv())
