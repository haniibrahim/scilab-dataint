Description: Toolbox for easy and interactive reading and writing of data files

 DataMENU offers a menu-driven interactice im-/export of data files, as comma-
 separated value (*.csv, *.dat, *.txt) and binary Excel files (*.xls). It 
 integrades a menu right beneath Scilab's main menu where you manage reading & 
 writing of your data files.
 
 Parameters to specify the im-/export can easily be entered in a dialog box and 
 the file selection is done by the platform-specific file-selection-dialog. 
 
 IMPORTANT: It does not handle data from the XML-based Excel files (.xlsx)!
 
 Furthermore it provides 3 functions which can be integrated in your own scripts
 to make use of DataMENU's interactive functionality.

 * DM_readxls
