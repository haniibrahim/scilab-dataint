Description: Toolbox for easy and interactive reading and writing of data files

 dataINT offers functions for convienient interactice im-/export of data files, 
 as comma-separated-value- (*.csv, *.dat, *.txt) and binary Excel files (*.xls)
 to or from a Scilab matrix. 
 
 They are based on the appropriate internal Scilab functions but make the im-
 and export much more user-friendly.
 
 Parameters to specify the im-/export can convieniently entered in a dialog box 
 and the file selection is done by the platform-specific file-selection-dialog.
 
 You can specify the following im-/export parameters:
 - Field separator (comma, semicolon, tab, space)
 - Decimal separator (comma, point)
 - Rows and Colums you want to import (DI_readcsv, DI_readxls only)
 - Sheet you want to import (DI_readxls only)
 - Number of lines to skip (e.g. header line(s), DI_readcsv, DI_readxls only)
 - Comment header line (to describe your data, DI_writecsv only)
 
 IMPORTANT: dataINT does not handle data from XML-based Excel files (.xlsx)!
 NOTE: dataINT handles doubles only. Strings are imported as NaN (%nan).
 
 The functions can easily integrated in your own scripts to make use of 
 dataINT's interactive functionality or to simplify your data import in 
 Scilab's console.
